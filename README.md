# SODAQ Core for SAMD21 CPU

This repository containts the source code and configuration files of the SODAQ Core
for Atmel's SAMD21 processor (used on the SODAQ Autonomo board).

This is a fork of https://github.com/SodaqMoja/SodaqCore-samd and only extends it with a `package.json`, a `version.txt` and the `CMSIS` header files in order to make it compatible with platformio. All other code is untouched and licensed under its oiginal license(s).
